# E-Commerce Churn Analysis — Shopshop Case Study

## Overview
This project analyzes customer churn behavior in a simulated e-commerce platform called Shopshop, focusing on identifying customer segments that are most likely to stop purchasing and developing actionable retention strategies.

## Objective
To understand which customer segments are prone to churn and why, using behavioral metrics. The ultimate goal is to design retention and loyalty strategies that reduce churn and increase long-term customer value.

## Methodology
1. Data Preparation – Cleaning, handling missing values, and removing duplicates.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding churn patterns by demographics, payment methods, and product categories.
3. Segmentation Analysis – Profiling churned customers and identifying high-risk groups.
4. Actionable Insights & Recommendations – Translating findings into business strategies for retention

## Key Findings
- 16.8% of total customers are churned users, most of whom have a tenure of less than 6 months.
- Major churn sources: City Tier 1 and Tier 3, primarily using Debit and Credit Cards.
- E-Wallet users in Tier 3 show growing churn patterns → indicating low trust and loyalty in smaller cities.
- Mobile Phone and Laptop & Accessories categories contribute the most to churn due to long product lifecycle and one-time purchase patterns.
